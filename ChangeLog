autodownloader-0.2.0
--------------------
-Reworked version by Hans de Goede, changes:
-add support for passing config file name through cmdline
-add support for using environment variables in the config file
-change the hardcoded Accept internet connection and Accept license windows,
 to a list of Message windows, which is configured through the config file
-return status other then 0 when download failed / was cancelled, or when the
 user clicked quit at the success window
-change reader.read_setting() to only take one param instead of 2 and let it
 construct the closing tag itself
-use one uniform window delete event handler for all window delete events
-directly download to destdir instead of doing a move afterward, get rid of
 copying dialog
-use mkstemp to create the check file to feed to "md5sum" instead of using a
 hardcoded check.txt. Now autodownloader no longer depends on being started
 from a dir to which it can (safely) write
-Remove EXEC setting from configfile, instead of executing the program for
 which we are downloading ourself, report a proper status to the caller and
 let the caller do any necessary execution. Returned exit statuses:
 0: download success, start program
 1: download failed or cancelled
 2: download success, but user has choosen to not to continue with
    starting the program
