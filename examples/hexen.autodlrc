This is a 4-level demo of the new action-adventure Hexen: Beyond Heretic, the sequel to the original Heretic first-person action-adventure. Besides the storyline, the major differences between Heretic and Hexen are numerous.

Enjoy the demo. Then rush out and get the game when it hits the stores! You won't be sorry. But your friends will be when they think they can take you on in a Deathmatch and they find a Maulotaur you just summoned bashing their brains into the dirt with you laughing at them behind its back.
